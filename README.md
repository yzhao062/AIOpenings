# cs-ece-ai-openings

ðŸ“Œ A curated and standardized list of **PhD, RA, and Intern openings** in  
**Computer Science (CS), Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).**

## ðŸ”— Current Frontend
At this moment, the **main entry point for students** is still hosted at:  
ðŸ‘‰ [tinyurl.com/2026phd](https://tinyurl.com/2026phd)  

This Google Sheet-based frontend is the easiest way to browse opportunities right now.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of this Initiative
While the Google Sheet is convenient, it is not sustainable in the long run:  
- **Scattered updates**: Professors need to request edit access, leading to inconsistency.  
- **Data formatting issues**: Columns are not standardized across entries.  
- **Scalability**: As the list grows, the Sheet becomes difficult to maintain.  

This GitHub repository is therefore launched as the **next step**:  
- A **standardized, open, and version-controlled database** of faculty openings.  
- Allowing **professors (PIs)** to submit or update their information through GitHub pull requests or connected forms.  
- Ensuring **students** can always access a clean, up-to-date, and searchable dataset (which can be mirrored to Google Sheet or other frontends).

## ðŸŒ± Our Vision
This initiative is community-driven and aims to:  
1. **Make opportunities more accessible** to students globally.  
2. **Provide transparency**â€”all changes are version-controlled and reviewable.  
3. **Reduce overhead for PIs** by giving them a consistent, lightweight way to share their openings.  
4. **Enable future tools** (search, filtering, visualization websites) to build directly on this standardized dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `universities_json/` â€“ Per-university JSON files (primary data source).  
- `tools/` â€“ Scripts for conversion and synchronization (e.g., Excel â†’ JSON).  
- `README.md` â€“ This file.  

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Continue maintaining the [Google Sheet frontend](https://tinyurl.com/2026phd) for easy browsing.  
- Gradually migrate all content to this GitHub repository.  
- Build automated workflows (e.g., JSON â†’ Google Sheet sync, website integration).

## ðŸ™Œ How to Contribute
- **Professors / PIs**:  
  You will be able to submit updates through Pull Requests or linked forms.  
- **Students**:  
  Continue using [tinyurl.com/2026phd](https://tinyurl.com/2026phd) for now, and stay tuned for a more advanced website frontend.
