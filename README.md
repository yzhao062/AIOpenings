# AIOpenings

ðŸ“Œ **AIOpenings Initiative** â€” A curated and standardized list of **PhD, RA, and Intern openings** in  
**Computer Science (CS), Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).**

## ðŸ”— Current Frontend
At this moment, the **main entry point for students** is still hosted at:  
ðŸ‘‰ [tinyurl.com/2026phd](https://tinyurl.com/2026phd)  

This Google Sheetâ€“based frontend is the easiest way to browse opportunities right now.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of AIOpenings
The **AIOpenings Initiative** was launched to create a **community-driven, standardized, and sustainable database** for academic openings.

Why move beyond Google Sheets?  
- **Scattered updates** â†’ Professors must request edit access, leading to inconsistency.  
- **Data formatting issues** â†’ Columns are not standardized across entries.  
- **Scalability** â†’ As the list grows, Sheets become difficult to maintain.  

With AIOpenings, we aim to:  
1. Provide a **clean, version-controlled dataset** of opportunities.  
2. Allow **faculty (PIs)** to submit or update information via pull requests or connected forms.  
3. Ensure **students** always have access to an up-to-date, structured resource.  
4. Enable the community to build tools (search, filtering, visualization websites) on top of the standardized data.

## ðŸŒ± Vision
This initiative is community-driven and aims to:  
- **Make opportunities more accessible** to students worldwide.  
- **Increase transparency**: all changes are version-controlled and reviewable.  
- **Reduce PI overhead** by providing a consistent and lightweight contribution process.  
- **Enable future extensions**: integration with websites, APIs, and advanced search interfaces.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `universities_json/` â€“ Per-university JSON files (primary dataset).  
- `tools/` â€“ Scripts for data conversion and synchronization (e.g., Excel â†’ JSON).  
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview.  

---

## ðŸš€ Roadmap
- âœ… Maintain Google Sheet frontend for browsing.  
- ðŸ”„ Gradually migrate all content into this GitHub repo.  
- ðŸ”œ Build automated workflows (e.g., JSON â†” Google Sheet sync, frontend website).  
- ðŸ”® Establish AIOpenings as a long-term community resource, similar in spirit to [CSRankings](http://csrankings.org/).

## ðŸ™Œ How to Contribute
- **Professors / PIs**:  
  You will be able to submit openings or updates through Pull Requests or connected forms.  
- **Students**:  
  For now, please continue using [tinyurl.com/2026phd](https://tinyurl.com/2026phd) as the primary browsing interface.
